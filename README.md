# AI Agent Chat Platform

A modern AI chatting website inspired by ChatGPT and Gemini. 

## Project Purpose
This project was built from the ground up to master modern backend development and AI integration. The primary focus is on learning and implementing:
* **FastAPI:** Building high-performance, asynchronous REST APIs.
* **AI Agents:** Designing stateful agents using LangGraph with conversational memory and tool-calling capabilities.
* **Database Management:** Designing relational database schemas to persist users, chat threads, and message histories using an ORM (SQLAlchemy).

## Tech Stack
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Python 3
* **AI Framework:** LangGraph, LangChain, Groq API
* **Database:** SQLite / SQLAlchemy
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

## Key Features (Work in Progress)
* **Real-time AI Chat:** A responsive chat interface with a smart AI assistant.
* **Chat History:** Users can create new threads, view past conversations, and switch between them.
* **Agentic Tools:** The AI is not just a text generator; it uses external tools to fetch real-world data before answering.
